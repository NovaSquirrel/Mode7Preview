# Mode7Preview
 This tool lets you write JavaScript to calculate and preview SNES Mode 7 parameters.
 Your code is called every scanline, with the scanline count passed in via a variable named `scanline`.
 There is an animation feature, where your code will be given a variable named `framecount` that increments every frame.

 The tool may be used [here](https://novasquirrel.github.io/Mode7Preview/).

 Rendering code is adapted from Mesen-S (which is why the code uses the same license).
